- [ ] Make sure design is consistent  
Things get out of place, as a designer it is our job to make sure everything is consistent and in place.

- [ ] Test it on multipe resolutions  
Whether it is a mobile app design or a web application you are designing, always test it on various device sizes before you handoff the design.

- [ ] Double check layer styles  
We use layer styles for every layers on our design files. Every text, every layer needs to have proper layer/text style.

- [ ] Update style guide  
Style guide is one of the main things that keeps the UI consistent. You need to update the style guide after creating a new component because every componenent needs to be in the style guide so that both developers and other designers can easily work on the project.

- [ ] Mark exportables ready  
We need to mark our image assets (icons, logos, images) exportables so that developers can download them within the Abstract.

- [ ] Create a collection on Abstract  
We use collections feature of Abstract. Every project needs to have a style guide collection along with the collections of every features.
