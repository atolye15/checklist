---

- [ ] Make sure the project covers all the related checklists  
E.g. If it's an Open-Source project you might want to refer to [Launching an Open-Source Project](/checklist/launching-an-open-source-project) Checklist.

- [ ] Share on Twitter  
For the social medias you need to follow [Posting on Social Media](/checklist/posting-on-social-media) Checklist.

- [ ] Share on Facebook

- [ ] Share on Instagram  

- [ ] Share on LinkedIn

- [ ] Share on HackerNews & Reddit  
Some projects may need to be published on HackerNews & Reddit too. 

- [ ] Publish on Product Hunt  
Publishing on Product Hunt depends on the project, you should discuss with your team about whether or not the project is going to be live on Product Hunt.

- [ ] Update Atolye15's portfolios  
For some projects you only need to update our profiles on [Clutch](https://clutch.co/profile/atolye15), [Top Developers](https://www.topdevelopers.co/profile/atolye15) or [Goodfirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/atolye15) and for some projects you also need to update our design portfolios; [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/atolye15) and [Behance](https://behance.net/atolye15).
