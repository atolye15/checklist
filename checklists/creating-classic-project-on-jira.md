---

- [ ] Check your role on Jira  
You must be a Jira admin in order to open a classic project. Otherwise, you can choose to continue with [Next-Gen Project](https://checklist.atolye15.com/checklist/creating-next-gen-project-on-jira).

- [ ] Navigate to the "Projects" page and click on the "Create Project" button   
You should continue with selecting "Classic Project".

- [ ] Give a familiar name to your project  
Name should be familiar to everyone in the Atolye15. Convince the team to use the same wording in any case afterwards.

- [ ] Provide a easy-to-say and well-sound key for the project  
Key must be maximum of 5 characters long. Key and name must be corresponded. Mostly, Atolye15 will finds a key for the project naturally even before you create the project, so you can use it.

- [ ] Select Scrum template  

- [ ] Navigate to the Project Settings / Details

- [ ] Provide project avatar and URL     
Avatar size must be 400x400. You can get help from a designer.

- [ ] Check the project lead, it should be the project manager of the project  

- [ ] Navigate to the Project Settings / Summary    

- [ ] Change the project issue type scheme to A15 Scrum Issue Type Scheme  
You can change the scheme by clicking the name of the scheme and then click on the Actions button. Select "Use a different scheme" option.

- [ ] Change the project workflow scheme to Atolye15 Workflow Scheme  
In order to do that, click on the workflow name. In the opening page click Switch Scheme button.

- [ ] Change the screens to ATL: Scrum Issue Type Screen Scheme  

- [ ] Change the project permissions scheme to Atolye15 Permission Default Scheme

- [ ] Don't forget to add team members to the project  
Now you're good to go.
