- [ ] Navigate to the "Projects" page and click on the "Create Project" button  
You should continue with selecting “Next-gen Project”.

- [ ] Give a familiar name to your project  
Name should be familiar to everyone in Atolye15. Convince the team to use the same wording in any case afterwards.

- [ ] Provide a easy-to-say and well-sound key for the project  
Key must be maximum of 5 characters long. Key and name must be corresponded. Mostly, Atolye15 will finds a key for the project naturally even before you create the project, so you can use it.

- [ ] Define accessibility  
You can customize the project view by choosing one of the “private, limited, open” options.

- [ ] Choose a next-gen template  
We usually work with the Scrum framework.

- [ ] Navigate to the Project Settings  
You can customize the project's issues, permissions and appearance in this menu.

- [ ] Select a category   
If you had a specific category in work space, you can choose one of them. 

- [ ] Provide project avatar and URL  
Avatar size must be 400x400. You can get help from a designer.

- [ ] Add team members to the project  
Navigate to the Project Settings / Access and add relative team members. 

- [ ] Determine issue types for project  
You can quickly update or change the fields and types your team uses to describe each type of work.

- [ ] Don’t forget to set features  
Generally we use Roadmap, Backlog, Estimation features in Atolye15’s projects.
