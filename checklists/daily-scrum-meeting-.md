- [ ] At first, set a specific time and place for the daily meeting  
So that, it will be easier for the team to gain habit.

- [ ] Check the time  
We prefer to do daily scrum meeting in the morning. So that everyone knows what will be done today. 

- [ ] Start to call your team  
Team will gain habit over time. You can use some clues while calling them, like the key of the project. Remind them it is daily time! 

- [ ] Remain standing!  
This way, meeting will(and should) last maximum 15 min.  

- [ ] Ensure everyone in the team is here

- [ ] Ask the fisrt question, "What did we do yesterday?"  
Give a chance to everyone to speak.

- [ ] Learn the answer of "What are we doing today?"  
Again, everyone must be give an answer.

- [ ] End up with "Is there any problem?"  
One can face with a problem and another can help.
