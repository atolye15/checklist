- [ ] Wake up at usual time  
Actually, since there is no travel to work time involved, you can -and definitely should- skip your first couple alarms.

- [ ] Air out your room  
It is highly important to air out your room, they said.

- [ ] Brew a good coffee  
No day should start without a coffee, make one.

- [ ] Make breakfast  
Or not, not everyone eats breakfast. And it's okay.

- [ ] Wash your hands  
Yeah, wash them good!

- [ ] Get on to your desk by 08:30  
You might want to consider connecting to Slack a couple minutes before that to catch the morning joke around.

- [ ] Join to your daily scrum meetings  
Every scrum team has their morning meetings around 08:30

- [ ] Get to work  
You might want to follow [Design Life-Cycle of a Jira Issue](/checklist/design-life-cycle-of-a-jira-issue) or [Coding Life-Cycle of a Jira Issue](/checklist/coding-life-cycle-of-a-jira-issue)

- [ ] Prepare lunch  
Since there is no Seço around :disappointed_relieved: , you should prepare your own lunch 

- [ ] Wash your hands  
This should be your at least 4th washing today.

- [ ] Check Slack for some more joke around  
There is %100 a joke around going on in the #goygoy channel.

- [ ] Join to mid-daily meetings  
It's 13:00, that means there is another scrum meeting going on in your team's Slack channel. Join it.

- [ ] Get back to work  
Pretty straight-forward, huh? Good.

- [ ] Check if it's ~16:45  
If so, it's daily CRM time. Follow the [CRM Checklist](/checklist/daily-crm-reporting-checklist).

- [ ] Check if you've wash your hands  
Smell them, look at them idk... Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew!

- [ ] Come back to this checklist tomorrow
